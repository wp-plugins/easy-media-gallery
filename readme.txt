= Images not showing up =

Sometimes you may face problem that your images are not displaying in the site. Here are some ways that you can try:

1. Click the add media button and choose the image you want, then look at the bottom right option (Attachment Display Settings), make sure to select Media File from Link to dropdown and select Full Size from Size dropdown. Please see this [SCREENSHOT](http://ghozylab.com/images/sshot.jpg)
1. If this still does not work please open thread from support forum [here](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/easy-media-gallery) or you can contact us [here](http://ghozylab.com/contactus).
